#### P1: Supervised Learning
 - On a census data set (>450000 records and 13 features), train a supervised machine learning model to predict whether an individualâ€™s income is above $50,000 annually. <br>

#### P2: Deep Learning (Neural Network)
 - Develop a classification APP to identify flower classes based on images using PyTorch. <br>
 
#### P3: Unsupervised Learning (Clustering and Dimenionality Reduction)
 - apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. <br>
